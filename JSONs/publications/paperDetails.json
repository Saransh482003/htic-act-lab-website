        "Description": "Image segmentation is a primary task in many medical applications. Recently, many deep networks derived from U-Net has been extensively used in various medical image segmentation tasks. However, in most of the cases, networks similar to U-net produce coarse and non-smooth segmentations with lots of discontinuities. To improve and refine the performance of U-Net like networks, we propose the use of parallel decoders which along with performing the mask predictions also perform contour prediction and distance map estimation. The contour and distance map aid in ensuring smoothness in the segmentation predictions. To facilitate joint training of three tasks, we propose a novel architecture called Psi-Net with a single encoder and three parallel decoders (thus having a shape of Ψ), one decoder to learn the segmentation mask prediction and other two decoders to learn the auxiliary tasks of contour …",

        "Description": "Local pulse wave velocity (PWV) is evolving as one of the important determinants of arterial hemodynamics, localized vessel stiffening associated with several pathologies, and a host of other cardiovascular events. Although PWV was introduced over a century ago, only in recent decades, due to various technological advancements, has emphasis been directed toward its measurement from a single arterial section or from piecewise segments of a target arterial section. This emerging worldwide trend in the exploration of instrumental solutions for local PWV measurement has produced several invasive and noninvasive methods. As of yet, however, a univocal opinion on the ideal measurement method has not emerged. Neither have there been extensive comparative studies on the accuracy of the available methods.

        "Description": "Objective Neonates and infants are patients who would benefit from less invasive vital sign sensing, especially from fewer cables and the avoidance of adhesive electrodes. Photoplethysmography imaging (PPGI) has been studied for medical applications in recent years: it is possible to assess various vital signs remotely, non-invasively, and without contact by using video cameras and light. However, studies on infants and especially on neonates in clinical settings are still rare. Hence, we conducted a single-center study to assess heart activity by estimating the pulse rate (PR) of 19 neonates. Approach Time series were generated from tracked regions of interest (ROIs) and PR was estimated via a joint time-frequency analysis using a short-time Fourier transform. Artifacts, for example, induced by movement, were detected and flagged by applying a signal quality index in the frequency domain. Main results The …",

        "Description": "Photoplethysmography imaging (PPGI) for non-contact monitoring of preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is a promising technology, as it could reduce medical adhesive-related skin injuries and associated complications. For practical implementations of PPGI, a region of interest has to be detected automatically in real time. As the neonates’ body proportions differ significantly from adults, existing approaches may not be used in a straightforward way, and color-based skin detection requires RGB data, thus prohibiting the use of less-intrusive near-infrared (NIR) acquisition. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based method for segmentation of neonatal video data. We augmented an existing encoder-decoder semantic segmentation method with a modified version of the ResNet-50 encoder.

Automated ECG interpretation is required to perform efficient screening of arrhythmia from long term ECG data.

        "Description": "Photoplethysmogram (PPG) is increasingly used to provide monitoring of the cardiovascular system under ambulatory conditions. Wearable devices like smartwatches use PPG to allow long-term unobtrusive monitoring of heart rate in free-living conditions. PPG based heart rate measurement is unfortunately highly susceptible to motion artifacts, particularly when measured from the wrist. Traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches rely on tri-axial accelerometer data along with PPG to perform heart rate estimation. The conventional learning based approaches have not addressed the need for device-specific modeling due to differences in hardware design among PPG devices. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning model to perform heart rate estimation using 8-second length input PPG signal. We evaluate the proposed model on the IEEE SPC 2015 dataset, achieving a mean …",

The results show that the wicking and test time are comparable to those obtained with conventional nitrocellulose (NC)-based LFAs. Further, the cellulose paper provides an excellent background with no auto-fluorescence that is very adequate in detecting fluorescent lines. While fluorescence that was generated with cellulose strips was lower when compared to that generated in NC strips, signals could be improved by layering carbon nanofibers (CNF) on the cellulose. A nonlinear behavior of the concentration–response relationship was observed for the LFA architectures with NC, cellulose, and cellulose-CNF in the 0 to 200 ng/mL cTnI concentration range. The measurements were consistent and characterized by coefficients of variation lower than 2.5%. Detection and quantitation limits that were in the range 1.28–1.40 ng/mL and 2.10–2.75 ng/mL were obtained for LFA with cellulose and cellulose CNF strips that are equivalent to the limits obtained with the standard NC LFA. Overall, we showed that commercially available filter paper can be used in the analytical strip of LFA.",

        "Description": "Objective Assessment of local arterial properties has become increasingly important in cardiovascular research as well as in clinical domains. Vascular wall stiffness indices are related to local pulse pressure (ΔP) level, mechanical and geometrical characteristics of the arterial vessel. Non-invasive evaluation of local ΔP from the central arteries (aorta and carotid) is not straightforward in a non-specialist clinical setting. In this work, we present a method and system for real-time and beat-by-beat evaluation of local ΔP from superficial arteries—a non-invasive, cuffless and calibration-free technique.   Methods The proposed technique uses a bi-modal arterial compliance probe which consisted of two identical magnetic plethysmograph (MPG) sensors located at 23 mm distance apart and a single-element ultrasound transducer. Simultaneously measured local pulse wave velocity (PWV) and arterial dimensions were used in a mathematical model for calibration-free evaluation of local ΔP. The proposed approach was initially verified using an arterial flow phantom, with invasive pressure catheter as the reference device. The developed porotype device was validated on 22 normotensive human subjects (age = 24.5 ± 4 years). Two independent measurements of local ΔP from the carotid artery were made during physically relaxed and post-exercise condition.   Results Phantom-based verification study yielded a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.93 (p < 0.001) for estimated ΔP versus reference brachial ΔP, with a non-significant bias and standard deviation of error equal to 1.11 mmHg and ±1.97 mmHg respectively.

The number of sonologists in low-and middle-income countries is very disproportionate to the extent of CVD. To bridge this gap we are developing an image-free CVD risk screening tool–arterial stiffness evaluation for non-invasive screening (ARTSENS™) which can be operated with minimal training. ARTSENS uses a single element ultrasound transducer to investigate the wall dynamics of the common carotid artery (CCA) and subsequently measure the AC. Identification of the proximal and distal walls of the CCA, in the ultrasound frames, is an important step in the process of the measurement of AC. The image-free nature of ARTSENS creates some unique issues which necessitate the development of a new algorithm that can automatically identify the CCA from a …",

        "Description": "The diagnosis, prognosis, and control of chronic kidney disease rely on an understanding of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The renal clearance of the cystatin-C is closely associated with the GFR. Cystatin-C is a more suitable GFR marker than the commonly used creatinine. General techniques for cystatin-C calculation, such as particle-enhanced turbidimetric and nephelometric assay, are time-consuming and tedious. Here, we propose a rapid, quantitative immunoassay for the detection of cystatin-C. A fluorescence-based lateral-flow kit was developed in a sandwich format by using a monoclonal antibody. A Linear calibration was obtained over the clinical diagnostic range of 0.023–32 µg/mL and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.023 µg/mL and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.029 µg/mL. Average recoveries from spiked urine samples ranged from 96–100% and the coefficient of variation was less than 4% for both intra and inter-day assays with excellent repeatability. With the comparison with an ELISA kit, the developed kit is highly sensitive, performs well over the detection range, provides repeatable results in a short time, and can easily be used at point-of-care (POC), making it an ideal candidate for rapid testing in early detection, community screening for renal function disorders.",

        "Description": "The biomechanical characteristics of arterial vessels assessed from a short segment (local estimates) are key cardiovascular clinical markers [1]. Local measurement of artery condition has the potential to quantify the prognostic value for the prediction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The elastic properties of large arteries affect locally during the pathophysiological process of various vascular disease such as atherosclerosis [2]. Pulse wave velocity assessed from a short vessel segment (local PWV) has been considered as an indicator of arterial stiffness. Local PWV is shown to correlate well with the mechanical characteristics of an artery over a wide physiological range [1, 3]. Researchers have demonstrated the potential of local PWV to evaluate blood pressure (BP) parameters locally from an artery without using the conventional bladder-type pressure cuff (cuffless technique)[4–6]. Simultaneously measured local PWV, arterial dimensions and local BP parameters are essential to accurately characterize and quantify the elastic behavior of central and peripheral arteries [1].A standard approach for local PWV measurement relies on simultaneous acquisition of the propagating blood pulse waves from two distinct locations at a known separation distance (ΔX) within a small arterial segment. Time taken for the blood pulse wave to travel ΔX distance (pulse transit time [ΔT]), is obtained as the time delay between an identifiable point (fiducial point) on the proximal and distal pulse cycle pair. Following the fundamental distance-time equation, local PWV is then calculated as; Local PWV= ΔX/ΔT. Typically, only one measure of local PWV per …",

An in-vivo experimental validation study was conducted on 10 healthy volunteers (8 male and 2 female, 21 to 33 years of age) to validate the PPG probe design and developed local PWV measurement system. The proposed system was able to measure carotid local PWV from multiple subjects. Beat-to-beat variation of baseline carotid PWV was less than 7.5% for 7 out of 10 subjects, a maximum beat-to-beat variation of 16% was observed during the study …",

        "Description": "It has become common for people to experience stress, mainly because of its eclectic nature - physical, psychological, emotional, social, etc. Unmonitored stress may prove harmful to one's health resulting in even chronic diseases. Since stress is very subjective, stress management is not straightforward. Many attempts have been made to detect and quantify stress. However, an accurate assessment can be made from physiological measurements only. In this study, we have demonstrated how electrodermal activity (EDA), which represents the sympathetic response to stress, could be used for accurate classification of stress by developing a machine learning based classification model. 30 participants were subjected to Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), and EDA and accelerometer data were recorded using a wrist-worn device.

The assay detection limit was 10 pg mL−1 with a diagnostics range of 0–400 pg mL−1. The assay coefficients of variation (CoVs) were less than 10%. Availability of the TRF-LFIA for blood testing would produce a paradigm shift in TBI patient management and clinical outcomes in trauma departments.

As a screening tool for a host of cardiovascular events and hypertension, high accuracies may not be required for the local PWV measures. However, such high accuracies are required when the yielded local PWV measures are directly used for calculations of other biomechanical and physiological parameters. There are several techniques for measuring local PWV and each possesses its own methodological challenges and considerations for ensuring accuracy. This work focuses on the salient methodological and measurement concerns of the transit time-based local PWV evaluation techniques while pinpointing the ones that are equally applicable to the other approaches.

The risk increases if the person is critically ill and bed-ridden. Changes in body weight in short intervals is the primary indicator for body fluid imbalances. Clinical practice involves the use of a dedicated weighing scale/lift scale, detachable/built-in units of weighing scale on the legs of hospital beds and integrated bed scales. These methods have limited mobility and usability in a clinical setting or higher cost. We propose a novel sensing module integrated with air-filled mattress for monitoring human body weight at periodic intervals. The method uses the air pressure of a mattress as a measure of changes in weight. The design was made modular so that it can be easily coupled into any hospital beds.

        "Description": "We are in process of developing an image-free, single element ultrasound system for automated evaluation of arterial stiffness, we call it ARTSENS. The lack of a guiding image for arterial visualization necessitates intelligent analysis of ultrasound radio frequency (RF) echo signals to obtain reliable measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to parameterize the echo signal received from the common carotid artery (CCA) to improve accuracy and reliability of arterial stiffness measurement. The echo signal quality is parameterized using features such as sharpness of arterial wall and energy ratio. A signal quality score is calculated by integrating the results from each feature. This score is used to triage the set of available echo signals recorded from each subject and select the best signal for computation of stiffness values. The performance of signal quality algorithm is tested using a database of …",

Real-time and dynamic analysis of plantar pressures require sensors that are in a wearable form factor. Sensor insoles built on a variety of principles satisfy this condition. The accuracy of total force provided by commercially available sensor insoles is significantly low compared to that provided by force plates, the gold standard for force measurements. The current work discusses the limitations of insole based force measurement from the design standpoint alone. We further propose a learning-based model to improve the accuracy of the capacitive sensor based insoles for the task of total force measurement. A learning-based model is developed by training on data collected from sensor insoles for loads varying from 0 to 80 kg on each insole.

The performance of this TRFIA was evaluated using the clinical urine serum and compared with the ELISA assays. The linear calibration range was 0.015–32 µg/ml, and the limit of detection (LOD) quantified was 0.0001 µg/ml.

Non-invasive estimation of arterial parameters is significant in the early detection of cardiovascular diseases. In this work, we present an arterial compliance probe for calibration-free evaluation of carotid pulse pressure. This novel cuffless measurement technique uses dual magnetic plethysmograph (MPG) transducers for carotid local pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurement and single element ultrasound transducer for measuring arterial dimensions. Proposed arterial compliance probe can acquire two blood pulse waveforms and arterial diameter parameters simultaneously, which are then utilized in cycle-to-cycle estimation of arterial local PWV and pulse pressure without any subject or population specific calibration.

We present the design of arterial compliance probes for measurement of local pulse wave velocity (PWV). Two designs of compliance probe are discussed, viz (a) a magnetic plethysmograph (MPG) based probe, and (b) a photoplethysmograph (PPG) based probe. The ability of the local PWV probes to consistently capture carotid blood pulse waves is verified by in-vivo trials on few volunteers. The probes could reliably perform repeatable measurements of local PWV from carotid artery along small artery sections less than 20 mm. Further, correlation between the measured values of local PWV using probes and various measures of blood pressure (BP) was also investigated. The study indicates that such arterial compliance probes have strong potential in cuff less BP monitoring.",

In this paper we propose a method based on temporal motion of PW and DW over successive A-Mode frames to locate the CCA.

The influence of the biasing magnetic field on the amplitude and shape of the detected signal is presented. Guidelines for the design of a bio-medical transducer using the principle are also provided. The detected biorhythm is compared to other bio signals such as the blood flow velocity and arterial distension to gain insight into the physiological significance of the detected signal. The analysis shows that the magnetic sensor provides a signal that is strongly correlated to the blood volume in the neighbourhood of the sensor.

In this paper, we study the feasibility of using reflectance photo plethysmography (PPG) for SpO2 monitoring from various measurement sites on body.

        "Description": "Hospital acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs) is a major problem that affects around one in twenty patients who are admitted in hospital with sudden illness. These ulcers often occur when patients have limited mobility and cannot change positions in bed on their own. Traditionally, the occurrence of HAPUs has been minimized by turning the patient every 2 hours to alternating lateral and supine positions, and by using pressure redistributing mattresses. In many healthcare facilities, such a patient repositioning schedule is not always maintained owing to low caregiver compliance to turning protocols. Difficulty in monitoring patient position continuously, lack of turn reminders/alerts and suboptimal caregiver staffing ratio increases the occurrence of HAPUs. A novel method to address the need for improved pressure ulcer prevention is presented. The proposed method consists of a wearable device which continuously …",

The equipment is a low cost and reliable alternative to the expensive B-mode scanner for vessel wall tracking and stiffness measurement of the artery. The system gives an accurate recording of the distensibility waveform of the carotid artery that could then be used to estimate the various measures of arterial compliance. The system is tested with phantom models of the carotid artery and the accuracy and resolution has been found to meet the requirements of the application. Results obtained from human trials have also been presented to illustrate the capability of the instrument to accurately measure carotid artery compliance.",

        "Description": "A new virtual instrument for real time, non invasive measurement of carotid artery compliance is proposed. The instrument is a reliable, compact and low cost alternative to the conventional ultrasound scanner and wall tracking system for carotid artery compliance measurement. The measurement system uses an ultrasound pulse echo method to probe the carotid artery. The reflected echoes are processed using Hilbert transform techniques. Peak detection and echo tracking are implemented in LabVIEW. A comparison is done between manual and automatic method of echo identification. The instrument gives a display of the variation of carotid diameter in real time and calculates the various estimates of arterial compliance from the analyzed data. The capability of the instrument to accurately determine arterial compliance measures is demonstrated by experiments performed on human subjects.",

        "Description": "Understanding and mapping the human connectome is a long-standing endeavor of neuroscience, yet the significant challenges associated with the large size of the human brain during cryosectioning remain unsolved. While smaller brains, such as rodents and marmosets, have been the focus of previous connectomics projects, the processing of the larger human brain requires significant technological advancements. This study addresses the problem of freezing large brains in aligned neuroanatomical coordinates with minimal tissue damage, facilitating large-scale distortion-free cryosectioning. We report the most effective and stable freezing technique utilizing an appropriate choice of cryoprotection and leveraging engineering tools such as brain master patterns, custom-designed molds, and a continuous temperature monitoring system. This standardized approach to freezing enables high-quality, distortion-free histology, allowing researchers worldwide to explore the complexities of the human brain at a cellular level. Our approach combines neuroscience and engineering technologies to address this long-standing challenge with limited resources, enhancing accessibility of large-scale scientific endeavors beyond developed countries, promoting diverse approaches, and fostering collaborations.",

High levels of stress could prolong post-operative recovery time, increasing the duration of hospitalization. Abnormally high stress levels could sometimes have irreversible impacts, leading to post-operative physiological and psychological disorders. Continuous monitoring of patients during the pre-operative period could help in taking necessary measures to control the stress levels. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the signals which is usually monitored continuously for patients in clinical settings. The usability of ECG for Heart Rate Variability (HRV) based stress detection has been explored in this study.

Modelling approaches for flow velocity simplify the wave separation analysis (WSA), providing a methodological and instrumentational advantage over the former; however, current methods are limited to the aortic site. In this work, a multi-Gaussian decomposition (MGD) modelled WSA (MGD WSA) is developed for a non-aortic site such as the carotid artery. While the model is an adaptation of the existing wave separation theory, it does not rely on the information of measured or modelled flow velocity.

Kit providers need to evaluate multiple parameters, including the location of test regions, sample flow speed, required sample volumes, reaction stability time, etc. A practical visualization tool assisting manufacturers in this process is very much required for the design of more sensitive and reliable quantitative LFIA test strips. In this paper, we present an image-based quantitative evaluation tool determining the practical functionality of fluorescence-labelled LFIA test cartridges. Image processing-based algorithms developed and presented in this paper provide a practical analysis of sample flow rates, reaction stability times of samples under test, and detect any abnormalities in test strips. Evaluation of the algorithm is done with Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1C) and Vitamin D test cartridges. Practical sample flow progress for HbA1C test cartridges is demonstrated. The reaction stability time of HbA1C test samples is measured to be 12 min, while that of Vitamin D test samples is 24 min. Experimental evaluation of the abnormality detection algorithm is carried out, and sample flow abnormalities are detected with 100% accuracy while membrane irregularities are detected with 96% accuracy.",

Traditionally, SpO2 monitoring has been carried out using transmittance pulse oximeters due to its dependability. However, SpO2 measurement from transmittance pulse oximeters is limited to peripheral regions. This becomes a disadvantage at very low temperatures as blood perfusion to the peripherals decreases. On the other hand, reflectance pulse oximeters can be used at various sites like finger, wrist, chest and forehead. Additionally, reflectance pulse oximeters can be scaled down to affordable patches that do not interfere with the user’s diurnal activities. However, accurate SpO2 estimation from reflectance pulse oximeters is challenging due to its patient dependent, subjective nature of measurement.

The PPG probe consists of two identical sensing modules placed 23 mm apart. Simultaneously measured blood pulse waveforms from these arterial sites were processed and the pulse transit time delay was resolved using the developed application-specific software. The ability of developed PPG probe and associated measurement system to detect acute changes in carotid local PWV due to blood pressure (BP) variations was experimentally validated by an in-vivo study. Intra-subject carotid BP elevation was achieved by an upper arm cuff based occlusion, which offered a controlled way of local PWV escalation. The elevated carotid BP values were also recorded by a calibrated pressure …",

The ZZ-CBM3 fusion provides a biomolecular interface between the cellulose layer and the Fc portion of the capture antibodies. By resorting to detection Fab fragments that lack the Fc portion we overcome the observed interference of full-length detection antibodies with the ZZ-CBM3 fusion at the test lines. Using the new LFA architecture, a linear concentration–response relationship was observed in the 0–10 ng/mL cystatin C concentration range, which is compatible with the clinically normal (5–120 ng/mL) and abnormal (> 250 ng/mL) levels of cystatin C, as long as proper dilutions are made.

A rising trend in these architectures is to employ joint-learning of the target region with an auxiliary task, a method commonly known as multi-task learning. These approaches help impose smoothness and shape priors, which vanilla FCN approaches do not necessarily incorporate. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play module, which we term as Conv-MCD, which exploits structural information in two ways - (i) using the contour map and (ii) using the distance map, both of which can be obtained from ground truth segmentation maps with no additional annotation costs.

CysC is a small protein that can be expressed by all nucleated cells.

That makes it a reliable biomarker for the measurement of the GFR. Aptamers bind specifically to the target molecules, it is less expensive, more stable, and lack immunogenicity. The aptamers became a valuable tool in clinical diagnosis and made them a great alternative to antibodies. In this study, we designed and developed an aptamer- antibody pair-based quantitative lateral flow assay for the CysC quantification in the human sample.

The validation study emulated constraints faced in evaluation of stiffness in field, such as measurement in sitting posture, use of brachial blood pressure for computations, limited time available for testing and lack of electrical power supply for instrument. The usability of the device and its accuracy, with respect to the reference ultrasound imaging system, was verified by conducting in-vivo measurements on 30 subjects. Stiffness measurements made using ARTSENS in sitting posture …",

        "Description": "The evaluation of arterial compliance is very important in cardiovascular screening of “at-risk” patients. Existing techniques for local arterial stiffness estimation put a premium on technology and operator expertise. Regional stiffness, measured in terms of the pulse wave velocity, is prone to errors in both path-length and delay estimation. Here, we present a Virtual Instrument (VI) for automated estimation of both local and regional arterial compliance measures. Local arterial compliance is evaluated by utilizing an ultrasound transducer to measure the distension and lumen diameter of the carotid artery. The regional stiffness is estimated from the pulse wave velocity, measured using two magnetic transducers in a dual-channel arrangement. The automated measurement algorithms are thoroughly analyzed, to identify and minimize possible error sources as well as to optimize the design of both the transducer and the …",

Measurements of vascular ageing are emerging as markers of cardiovascular risk, with potential applications in disease diagnosis and prognosis, and for guiding treatments. However, vascular ageing is not yet routinely assessed in clinical practice. A key step towards this is the development of technologies to assess vascular ageing. In this Roadmap, experts discuss several aspects of this process, including: measurement technologies; the development pipeline; clinical applications; and future research directions. The Roadmap summarises the state of the art, outlines the major challenges to overcome, and identifies potential future research directions to address these challenges.",

        "Description": "The arterial pulse waveform has an immense wealth of information in its morphology yet to be explored and translated to clinical practice. Wave separation analysis involves decomposing a pulse wave (pressure or diameter waveform) into a forward wave and a backward wave. The backward wave accumulates reflections due to arterial stiffness gradient, branching and geometric tapering of blood vessels across the arterial tree. The state-of-the-art wave separation analysis is based on estimating the input impedance of the target artery in the frequency/time domain, which requires simultaneously measured or modelled flow velocity and pressure waveform. We are proposing a new method of wave separation analysis using a multi-gaussian decomposition. The novelty of this approach is that it requires only a single pulse waveform at the target artery. Our method was compared against the triangular waveform …",

In this work, we explore and validate the viability of a bi-modal probe for local evaluation of PWV variation over the cardiac cycle as a function of arterial pressure. The proposed probe employs singleelement ultrasound transducer (for diameter measurement) and tonometric sensor (for pressure measurement) integrated into a custom probe holder.

We propose an automatic method that uses an adaptive threshold to track the desired number of echoes and measure the artery diameter accurately.

Measurement of BP is one of the most useful parameters for early diagnosis. In this paper, we present a unique approach for extensive BP measurement that involves Machine Learning (ML) techniques which utilizes the extracted inherent features that are characteristic of arterial pressure and pulse transit relationships. Concurrent measurement of luminal diameter waveform were obtained from the arterial segments using our developed dualchannel A-mode ultrasound system and a probe with a pair of single-element ultrasound transducers. The data recorded by carrying out an in vivo study of 20 subjects was trained and validated on three ML and one Deep Learning (DL) models.

A set of parameters that can be used to distinguish between arterial and venous occlusions are identified and quantified.

        "Description": "Background Ethnicity impacts cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, and South Asians demonstrate a higher risk than White Europeans. Arterial stiffness is known to contribute to CVD, and differences in arterial stiffness between ethnicities could explain the disparity in CVD risk. We compared central and local arterial stiffness between White Europeans and South Asians and investigated which factors are associated with arterial stiffness.   Methods Data were collected from cohorts of White Europeans (the Netherlands) and South Asians (India). We matched cohorts on individual level using age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Arterial stiffness was measured with ARTSENS® Plus. Central stiffness was expressed as carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV, m/s), and local carotid stiffness was quantified using the carotid stiffness index (Beta) and pressure-strain elastic modulus (Epsilon, kPa). We compared arterial stiffness between cohorts and used multivariable linear regression to identify factors related to stiffness.   Results We included n = 121 participants per cohort (age 53±10 years, 55% male, BMI 24 kg/m2). Cf-PWV was lower in White Europeans compared to South Asians (6.8±1.9 vs. 8.2±1.8 m/s, p<0.001), but no differences were found for local stiffness parameters Beta (5.4±2.4 vs. 5.8±2.3, p = 0.17) and Epsilon (72±35 vs. 70±31 kPa, p = 0.56). Age (standardized β, 95% confidence interval: 0.28, 0.17–0.39), systolic blood pressure (0.32, 0.21–0.43), and South Asian ethnicity (0.46, 0.35–0.57) were associated with cf-PWV; associations were similar between cohorts (p>0.05 for interaction).

Its practical feasibility and the measurement accuracy were demonstrated in-vivo using a custom image-free ultrasound device, with the Bramwell-Hill method as the reference.Results The proposed technique and developed device reliably captured incremental local PWV from the carotid artery.

However, chronic fluid variations can occur and are often associated with pathological conditions like renal insufficiency and/or medications.

Recent years have seen the emergence of Bioimpedance Spectroscopy (BIS) as a potential tool for TBW estimation with a unique capacity to differentiate between the extracellular and intracellular water content. The design and implementation of a hand-to-hand bioimpedance spectrometer for TBW estimation which can measure impedances within the range of 5.3 Ω to 5.3 kΩ in the β dispersion region of tissue between 500 Hz and 1 MHz is presented in this paper.

Its implementation, however, requires arterial pressure and diameter waveforms simultaneously from a single site. Owing to the challenges associated with such a noninvasive recording, an approximated BH equation is adopted without requiring the entire pressure waveform but only the diastolic and systolic values. The approximated BH method yields a single value of local PWV as opposed to the actual method that provides instantaneous PWV within a cardiac cycle. This study aims to provide the currently lacking insights into how the approximate versus actual BH implementations compare. The study also addresses the pivotal question of which instantaneous value within the cardiac cycle corresponds to the approximated BH. An ex-vivo study …",

        "Description": "Conventional methods to calculate reflection transit time (RTT) is based on pulse counter analysis. An alternative to this approach is separating forward and backward components from a pulse waveform to calculate the RTT. State-of-the-art in wave separation requires simultaneously measured pressure and flow velocity waveforms. Practically, getting a simultaneous measurement from a single arterial site has its limitations, and this has made the translation of wave separation methods to clinical practice difficult. We propose a new method of wave separation analysis that requires only a single pulse waveform measurement using a multi-Gaussian decomposition approach. The novelty of the method is that it does not require any measured or modelled flow velocity waveform. In this method, the pulse waveform is decomposed into the sum of Gaussians and reconstructed based on model criteria. RTT is calculated …",

Mitotic count is an important biomarker for predicting the breast cancer prognosis according to Nottingham Grading System. Pathologists look for tumour areas and select 10 HPF(high power field) images and assign a grade based on the number of mitotic counts. Mitosis detection is a tedious task because the pathologist has to inspect a larger area. The pathologist’s views about mitotic cell are also subjective. Because of these problems, an assisting tool for the pathologist will generalize and reduce the time for diagnosis. Due to recent advancements in whole slide imaging, CAD(computer-aided diagnosis) systems are becoming popular.

It uses a single element ultrasound transducer to obtain A-mode frames from a superficial artery such as the common carotid artery (CCA) and analyzes them to obtain the stiffness parameters of the vessel. We have earlier demonstrated that ARTSENS can accurately measure local arterial stiffness (LAS) and regional arterial stiffness (RAS) by tracing the distension waveforms of the CCA and the femoral artery. In this paper, we show that it is possible to estimate the augmentation index (AIx), a measure of the global arterial mechanics, from the distension waveforms obtained by ARTSENS.

However, pulse wave reflections can impair the accuracy of local PWV measurements. We propose a method to measure pressure-dependent variations in local PWV while minimizing the influence of pulse wave reflections. The PWV is computed from the pulse transit time between two forward-traveling pulse waveforms obtained across known path length, after measured/modelled flow-based wave separation analysis (WSA). An in-vivo study of 60 participants (24 female), was conducted to compare inter- and intra-cycle variations in PWV obtained from measured and forward pulse waves. For this, proximal and distal diameter waveforms from the carotid artery, along with carotid tonometry, were recorded using a custom bi-modal …",

A simplified approach to WSA, which involves modelling the flow waveform, offers a methodological advantage over the conventional method. Nevertheless, the current methods of pressure-only WSA is constrained to the aortic site. In this study, we propose a method to model the carotid artery flow rate waveform using multi-Rayleigh functions (Qm-RAY(t)) for WSA (WSAm-RAY). The carotid artery is associated with central and cerebral haemodynamics and has an anatomical advantage for easier accessibility of non-invasive measurements, unlike the aorta.

        "Description": "Staining is a critical step in tissue analysis as it enhances the visibility and contrast of tissue structures for microscopic examination. Large tissue sections such as the human brain, heart, and liver are becoming increasingly important in studying complex tissue structures, providing critical information about the tissue’s normal or abnormal development, function, and disease processes. Manual staining methods are still widely used and are prone to inconsistencies and inaccuracies, leading to unreliable results. Commercially available automated staining systems offer a more efficient alternative, but currently, these systems are only available for smaller 1\" x 3\" slides which are ill-suited for examining larger tissue sections. To address this challenge, we present a custom-designed Large format Automated Slide Stainer that can handle various glass slides, from the standard 1\" x 3\" slides to the custom-sized 2\" x 3\", 5\" x …",

It estimates local stiffness metrics (Ep, β, and AC) by employing a one-point patient-specific calibration on the features of acceleration plethysmogram (APG) signal. An in-vivo study on 12 subjects was conducted (a) to select suitable ones from the host features on which the calibration could be applied and (b) to assess the feasibility of reliably estimating the stiffness metrics post-exercise when calibrated prior. The acquired APG signals were found to be reliable (SNR > 38 dB) and repeatable (CoV < 10 %).

Therefore, there is an urgent need for a precise diagnostic tool at the field level to detect the pathogenic Leptospira lipL32 gene at the molecular level for prompt therapeutic decisions. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is widely used as the primary diagnostic tool, but its applicability is limited by high equipment cost and the lack of availability in every hospital, especially in rural areas where leptospirosis mainly occurs. Here, we report the development of a CRISPR dFnCas9-based quantitative lateral flow immunoassay to detect the lipL32 gene. The developed assay showed superior performance regarding the lowest detectable limit of 1 fg/mL. The test is highly sensitive and selective, showing that leptospirosis diagnosis can be achieved with a low-cost lateral flow device.",

Despite numerous studies in the arterial domain indicating PWV as a metric for stiffness assessment, only a few studies are predicated on veins.

The device could acquire simultaneous jugular venous pulses (JVP) from two proximal sites along the internal jugular vein (JV) at a framerate of 500 Hz. The time delay between the measured JVP cycles was computed as the venous pulse transit time (vPTT). An in-vivo study was conducted on a cohort of 20 participants (10 male, 10 female) where the feasibility of local vPWV measurement was validated.

Although carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity is typically used for vascular age assessment, most recent studies have reported the need to consider a combination of local and regional stiffness indices possessing distinct association with the vascular structure and/or function for better prediction of early vascular ageing syndrome. In this work, we investigate the association of clinically validated local stiffness (obtained using biomechanical relations), global stiffness (obtained from 3-element Windkessel modelling), and pulse contour indices from the aorta with ageing and their distribution in normotensives and hypertensives.

Estimation of ZC is useful for indirect evaluation of local pulse wave velocity and crucial for solving wave separation analysis (WSA) which separates the forward-backward pressure and flow velocity waveforms. As opposed to conventional WSA, which requires simultaneous measurement of pressure and flow velocity waveform, simplified WSA relies on modelled flow velocity waveforms, mainly introduced for the aorta. This work uses a multi-Gaussian decomposition (MGD) modelled flow velocity waveform to estimate ZC by employing a frequency domain analysis, which is applicable to other arteries such as carotid. Thus obtained ZC is compared with Zc estimated from true flow velocity waveform for healthy (virtual) subjects taken for the carotid artery. The MGD modelled …",

Echocardiography technique is widely used to view 2D image of heart in non invasive method using ultrasound. In practice, echocardiography devices typically use multi-element phased array transducer which involves complex algorithms and computations to develop M-Mode images, which are used to measure parameters by placing the cursors manually. A simple hardware with single element ultrasound transducer has been used to record M-Mode images on a single axis.

        "Description": "Arterial blood pressure (BP) parameters are key hemodynamic indices often used for screening and diagnosis of various pathophysiological conditions. Brachial artery BP measurement using a bladder-type pressure cuff and sphygmomanometer (auscultatory or oscillometric technique) is a routine part of clinical assessments. Over the past few years, the interest in methods that allow noninvasive, cuffless evaluation of BP parameters has increased to overcome the fundamental limitations of cuffbased techniques [1]. Cuffless techniques rely on exploring the relationship between BP and BP-dependent noninvasively measurable physiological parameters. Such theoretical or heuristic mathematical models generally require subject-and/or population-specific calibration procedure to quantitatively convert the acquired physiological parameters into pressure. Pulse transit time estimates, arterial vessel characteristics, and various hemodynamic indices are typically utilized to implement cuffless BP evaluation techniques [2]; these parameters are subject specific. Hence, a calibration curve and/or BP prediction model that is tailored to each subject would be optimal for accurate measurement [3]. Further, these calibration curves/models would have to be updated at regular intervals for accurate and reliable BP evaluation [2].In order to develop subject-specific calibration curves or data-driven prediction models, the desired input physiological parameters should be recorded over a wide range of BP values from the subject. For this, resting BP level should alter via suitable BP perturbing interventions. Calibration curves or prediction models obtained through …",

        "Description": "Non-invasive assessment of arterial elastic properties is of high interest in cardiovascular research and screening of the vascular health. Over the last decades, a great emphasis has been placed on quantifying arterial stiffness, and its pathological significance is asserted in various epidemiological studies [1]. Typically used arterial elastic indices such as distensibility coefficient (DC), compliance coefficient (CC), and Peterson modulus (EP) provide the measure of the functional stiffness of the artery. On the other hand incremental Young’s elastic modulus (Einc) quantifies material or intrinsic stiffness and hence properly characterizes the non-linear elastic behavior of the artery [2]. It has been recently demonstrated that the standard deviation in Einc is an independent biomarker of coronary heart diseases [3]. The absolute value of Einc varies within a cardiac cycle during diastolic to systolic phase. Accurate evaluation …",

Critically ill subjects who are in the intensive care unit (ICU) and under mechanical ventilator support are more prone to VAP. Traditionally, VAP bundle is used in hospitals for prevention of VAP. VAP bundle consists of five protocols which must be observed by the caregiver at regular intervals of time. One of the critical protocol steps is to always maintain the patient's head up angle at 30-45 degrees. This is not always strictly followed by caregivers due to lack of continuous monitoring and alert mechanisms. Hence a novel method is proposed which includes a wearable sensor which is attached to the patient's body, continuously monitoring the patient's head up angle and a tablet-based system that reminds the caregiver as and when required to help comply with the VAP …",

The \"vascular age\" obtained from carotid ultrasound is very commonly used as a measure of cardiac health. Existing methods of vascular age estimation make use of the Carotid Intima Media Thickness (CIMT) measurements to arrive at an estimate of the vascular age. Recent work has demonstrated that the carotid inter adventitial distance (CAD) has a direct relation with the risk of coronary heart disease in persons. It has also been demonstrated that CAD correlates better to a number of risk factors accounting for heart disease than the CIMT. Hence, we propose a method to estimate vascular age based on CAD.

        "Description": "The human brain is believed to contain a full complement of neurons by the time of birth together with a substantial amount of the connectivity architecture, even though a significant amount of growth occurs postnatally. The developmental process leading to this outcome is not well understood in humans in comparison with model organisms. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies give three-dimensional coverage but not cellular resolution. In contrast, sparsely sampled histological or spatial omics analyses have provided cellular resolution but not dense whole brain coverage. To address the unmet need to provide a quantitative spatiotemporal map of developing human brain at cellular resolution, we leveraged tape-transfer assisted serial section histology to obtain contiguous histological series and unbiased imaging with dense coverage. Interleaved 20μ thick Nissl and H&E series and MRI volumes are co-registered into multimodal reference volumes with 60μ isotropic resolution, together with atlas annotations and a stereotactic coordinate system based on skull landmarks. The histological atlas volumes have significantly more contrast and texture than the MRI volumes. We computationally detect cells brain-wide to obtain quantitative characterization of the cytoarchitecture of the developing brain at 13-14 and 20-21 gestational weeks, providing the first comprehensive regional cell counts and characterizing the differential growth of the different brain compartments. Morphological characteristics permit segmentation of cell types from histology. We detected and quantified brain-wide distribution of mitotic figures representing …",

The WSAm-RAY reduces the measurement complexity, by modelling the flow waveform shape, targeted at scenarios with limited resources, where comprehensive equipment, specialized personnel and hospital settings are often lacking.

However, it’s robustness to motion artifacts and the absence of reliability when the patient’s face is not in the camera’s field of view still persists. This is often addressed with computationally heavy AI algorithms or hardware intensive multi-camera systems. Here, we investigate the improvement in accuracy and reliability of noncontact HRM by augmenting vision with an unobtrusive near field sensing modality such as ballistocardiography. The system seamlessly transitions between the two modalities based on a real time signal quality index (SQI). The SQI parameter was able to discard segments of higher errors and select the data stream with lower error. The proposed system was validated on data collected from 20 subjects, with induced motion and facial occlusions to create artifacts. The accuracy was validated …",

The gold standard technique of central venous line catheterization is invasive, risky, and demands expertise and hence performed only in critical care settings.

The JVP piezo signals were acquired from 20 healthy participants and were validated against the reference ultrasound approach.

        "Description": "Non-contact methods for monitoring respiration face limitations when it comes to selecting the chest region of interest. The semi-automatic method, which requires the user to select the chest region in the first frame, is not suitable for real-time applications. The automatic method, which tracks the face first and then detects the chest region based on the face’s position, can be inaccurate if the face is not visible or is rotated. Moreover, using the face region to track the chest region can under-utilize camera pixels since the face is not essential for monitoring respiration. This approach may adversely affect the quality of the respiration signal being measured. To address these issues, we propose a face-free chest detection model based on Convolutional Neural Networks. Our model enhances the measured non-contact respiration signal quality and utilizes more pixels for the chest region alone. In our quantitative study, we …",

These approaches assume PWV to be constant, whereas, it changes with pressure. Pertaining to this, literature is unclear on which instantaneous local PWV value should be chosen within the cardiac cycle for PP evaluation. Since local PWV can be measured from various fiducial points spread across the blood pulse cycle, it may be relevant to investigate on the choice of particular one(s) for reliable PP calculation.

Elevated levels of wave reflections cause an increase in pulse pressure and pulse propagating speeds, exacerbating cardiovascular risk. Quantification of reflection markers is either based on augmentation index or reflection magnitude (RM) and reflection index (RI), both derived from wave separation analysis (WSA). Simultaneous measurement of pressure and flow velocity from the same arterial site is a requirement for WSA and has its practical challenges. Subsequently, simplified WSA based on modelling flow is proposed.

However, the cost of multiple M-line-based imaging modalities and the extensive operator expertise requirements hamper the large-scale application for arterial properties assessment, particularly in resource-constrained settings. This study is aimed to assess the performance of a single M-line approach as an affordable and easy-to-use alternative to multiple M-line imaging for screening purposes. Methods: We used triplicate longitudinal common carotid artery (CCA) ultrasound recordings (17 M-lines covering about 16 mm, at 500 frames per second) of 500 subjects from The Maastricht Study to assess the validity and reproducibility of a single against multiple M-line approach. The multiple M-line measures were obtained by averaging over all available 17 lines, whereas the middle M-line was used as a proxy for the single M-line approach. Results: Diameter, intima-media thickness (IMT), and Young's elastic modulus (YEM) were not significantly different between the single and multiple M-line approaches (p > 0.07). Distension and distensibility coefficient (DC) did differ significantly (p < 0.001), however, differences were technically irrelevant. Similarly, Bland-Altman analysis revealed good agreement between the two approaches. The single M-line approach, compared to multiple M-line, exhibited an acceptable reproducibility coefficient of variation (CV) for diameter (2.5 vs. 2.2%), IMT (11.9 vs. 7.9%), distension (10 vs. 9.4%), DC (10.9 vs. 10.2%), and YEM (26.5 vs. 20.5%).

        "Description": "Cardiovascular community has started clinically adopting the assessment of local stiffness, contrary to the traditionally measured carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV). Though they offer higher reliability, ultrasound methods require advanced hardware and processing methods to perform real-time measurement of local PWV. This work presents a system and method to perform online PWV measurement in an automated manner. It is a fast image-free ultrasound technology that meets the methodological requirements necessary to measure small orders of local pulse transit, from which PWV is measured. The measurement accuracy and repeatability were assessed via phantom experiments, where the measured transit time-based PWV (PWVTT) was compared against the theoretically calculated PWV from Bramwell-Hill equation (PWVBH). The beat-to-beat variability in the measured PWVTT was within 3 …",

It uniquely analyses the time-varying effects of tissue dynamics on the amplitude and phase features of the RF signals.

The recording was performed by an ultrasound imaging system where the B-mode video clips and the raw RF data were saved simultaneously for direct comparison of the proposed method’s versus B-mode reference measurements.

This change in PWV has shown its potential as a biomarker for advanced cardiovascular diagnostics, screening, and has recently started using as a vascular screening tool and medical device development. In this work, we have demonstrated the concept of inter and intra-cycle variations of PWV with pressure using an excised bovine carotid artery. Results demonstrated that local PWV measured at the foot of the waveform followed the same trend as of the pressure.

This is a proven pathophysiological basis for cardiovascular risks, chronic kidney diseases, and end-organ damage.

        "Description": "Evaluation of vascular compliance is significant in cardiovascular diagnosis and screening. We present a novel ultrasound vascular compliance probe with integrated electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor, designed for quick and reliable evaluation of arterial compliance. The probe measures the compliance of the carotid artery using image-free ultrasound technique, and also measures the pulse arrival time (PAT) with the ECG signal. Automated measurement algorithms enable even general medical practitioners with little or no knowledge of vascular ultrasonography to measure vascular compliance parameters using this probe. The results of measurements performed on human volunteers by untrained personnel are reported to illustrate the practical utility of the system. The proposed vascular compliance evaluation system can pave the way for an effective and inexpensive cardiovascular screening tool.",

In this work, we show that precision measurements can be used to capture power signals from such a scaled down plant in a 600 mm wave flume. The measurement is difficult because the no load losses of the turbine motor exceed that generated from waves in a proposed twin unidirectional turbine topology. Twin 100 mm turbine models driven by brushless DC motors serve as the power module. Signals captured with 16-bit resolution are used to demonstrate the twin turbine concept.",

The demand for real-time non-contact physiological measurement has surged, particularly during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to facilitate telehealth and remote health monitoring. Here, we propose an attention-based knowledge distillation (KD) method called KDPhys to extract the rPPG signal from the facial video frames. It effectively distills global temporal information from a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) based teacher network to a 2D CNN-based student network, utilizing 3D to 2D feature distillation.

        "Description": "Heart transplantation remains the definitive treatment for advanced heart failure. Despite over five decades of advancements in transplantation, the fundamental approach to organ preservation outside the body has remained largely unchanged. Traditionally, the field has relied on static cold storage (SCS) as the clinical standard for preserving hearts from donors after brainstem death. While effective, SCS presents practical limitations, particularly in mitigating ischemic damage, assessing the organ quality in storage and transport, and expanding the donor pool to include extended-criteria donors or donations after circulatory death (DCD). The emergence of ex-vivo machine perfusion, a transformative innovation, offers enhanced preservation by reducing the risk of ischemic damage alongside the ability to assess and optimize grafts from extended-criteria donors and those obtained through DCD. This chapter explores the pivotal role of cardiac biomarkers in graft evaluation within this emerging technology, categorized into functional markers, cell injury and cell death markers, inflammatory markers, omics-based markers, and hormone/pro-hormone markers. By enhancing precision in identifying transplantable hearts, these biomarkers play a crucial role in improving the safety and efficacy of marginal graft utilization, providing reassurance about the advancements in the field. The chapter also includes practical recommendations for integrating these biomarkers into clinical protocols and outlines future research directions to drive innovation in cardiac transplantation.",

The reference standard, central venous line catheterization, while precise, is restricted to critical care units owing to the necessity for surgical procedures and specialized operator skills. Conventional ultrasound imaging systems can reliably measure jugular venous vessel dynamics but are hindered by low operational frame rates, large form factors, and the requirement for trained operators. In this study, we propose a portable system using single-element ultrasound technology for reliable JVP waveform acquisition and methods for quantifying the JVP contour features. The performance of the system and method was validated against a reference ultrasound imaging system in a preclinical study on 65 asymptomatic volunteers (27 female). Operating at an …",

ROIs were defined by the exterior coordinates of these skin pixels, adapting naturally to features like forehead size, cheek size, hairstyles, and spectacles. To address the challenge of ROIs with insufficient skin pixel coverage, we integrated Google MediaPipe landmarks to refine ROI selection, ensuring that at least 30 percent of the pixels in each region were skin pixels. The adaptive multi-ROI method was compared with traditional single-forehead and non-adaptive multi-ROI methods using the POS and CHROM rPPG …",

We analysed the signaling of endothelial and muscle reactivity through vessel diameter, flow velocity, and electromyography (EMG) responses. In a controlled study with 15 participants, a 30-second HG intervention induced significant changes: vessel diameter increased by 13.94%, flow velocity by 22.31%, and for EMG, the average rectified value (ARVEMG) by 87.44%. Baseline measurements included vessel diameter of 4.23 ± 0.38 mm, flow velocity of 10.91 ± 0.92 cm/s, and ARVEMG of 0.0011 ± 0.0003 mV.

        "Description": "The human brain is believed to contain a full complement of neurons by the time of birth together with a substantial amount of the connectivity architecture, even though a significant amount of growth occurs postnatally. The developmental process leading to this outcome is not well understood in humans in comparison with model organisms. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies give three-dimensional coverage but not cellular resolution. In contrast, sparsely sampled histological or spatial omics analyses have provided cellular resolution but not dense whole brain coverage. To address the unmet need to provide a quantitative spatiotemporal map of developing human brain at cellular resolution, we leveraged tape-transfer assisted serial section histology to obtain contiguous histological series and unbiased imaging with dense coverage. Interleaved 20μ thick Nissl and H&E series and MRI volumes are co-registered into multimodal reference volumes with 60μ isotropic resolution, together with atlas annotations and a stereotactic coordinate system based on skull landmarks. The histological atlas volumes have significantly more contrast and texture than the MRI volumes. We computationally detect cells brain-wide to obtain quantitative characterization of the cytoarchitecture of the developing brain at 13-14 and 20-21 gestational weeks, providing the first comprehensive regional cell counts and characterizing the differential growth of the different brain compartments. Morphological characteristics permit segmentation of cell types from histology. We detected and quantified brain-wide distribution of mitotic figures representing …",

Ultrasound-based assessment of diameter response to shear stress measured as the proportion of brachial dilatation caused by reactive hyperemia (RH), is the gold standard for evaluating endothelial reactivity. However, the conventional approach does not account for the transient increase in blood flow and subsequent change in the transmural pressure that stimulates the endothelial cells to dilate the artery. In this work, simultaneous measures of blood flow and blood pressure during RH are used to evaluate the response of the brachial artery impedance. Endothelial reactivity is assessed using a three-element impedance blood flow model of the brachial artery. A significant change (> 30%) was observed in the impedance parameters in response to RH. The results were repeatable (ICC > 0.64) over 2 …",

The mSTEP algorithm was rigorously evaluated on a dataset comprising 350 recordings with manually annotated SBP and DBP for ground truth value. Implementation of the algorithm yielded successful identification of both SBP and DBP, with errors of -1.5 ± 6.6 mmHg and 3.8 ± 7.6 mmHg, respectively, with insignificant bias (p<0.0001).

It has been accelerated by the emergence of learning-based models. Most use multiple pulse signals such as ECG, PPG, etc. rely on pulse transit time estimates and related features for estimating BP. However, the accuracy and reliability of such methods are questionable and hence there has been limited clinical uptake. This study focuses on evaluating the accuracy obtained from different machine learning models in classifying blood pressure using PPG signals. Specifically, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Bagging Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier were studied. These models were trained and tested using data from the PulseDB dataset.

        "Description": "Central blood pressure (CBP), which is the pressure at the aorta and other central arterial sites such as the carotid, is more predictive of target organ damage and future adverse events, as opposed to conventional blood pressure assessed at more peripheral sites. However, methods to estimate CBP are complex, require frequent calibration and are not suitable for continuous tracking purposes. Here, we introduce a wearable accelerometer based pressure sensing system to track carotid pulse pressure (PP). The wearable system detects the transcutaneous pressure (PT) on the skin surface over the carotid artery and identifies the key fiducial points (g1, g2). In-vivo study on 11 subjects showed that the peak-to-peak value, ΔPT and maximum value, g2 of PT have a statistically significant and strong correlation with carotid PP (r = 0.75, p < 0.05) and SBP (r = 0.78, p < 0.05) respectively.

Despite a large body of clinical evidence, cfPWV is not routinely assessed in clinical practice nor used for ambulatory or self-monitoring, as it requires access to the femoral site, which leads to poor subject compliance for the assessment. Heart-carotid PWV (hcPWV) is a potential alternative for measuring aortic arterial stiffness in settings where cf-PWV is challenging to measure. We introduce a novel device for easy and reliable measurement of hcPWV, using simultaneously acquired phonocardiogram (PCG) signals at the heart and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals at the carotid. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of in-vivo measurements of hcPWV in 30 subjects and examine its association with cfPWV. The agreement between …",

The clinical practice for periodic monitoring of body weights of critically ill or bedridden patients includes a dedicated weighing scale or lift scale, detachable or built-in units of weighing scale on to the legs of hospital cots or as integrated bed scales attached permanently to the cot. However, these methods have limited mobility and usability in a practical setting and often require the involvement of multiple personnel to measure the body weight of a bedridden patient.

Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV) is a gold standard technique for non-invasively assessing large artery stiffness. The state-of-the-art cf-PWV measuring devices necessitate expertise and are not pertinent for routine care in non-clinical settings. To address this gap, we have developed an acoustic plethysmography device for cf-PWV measurement. An in-vitro test on an arterial phantom was performed to ensure the device's reliability.

        "Description": "This paper addresses the critical need for online action representation, which is essential for various applications like rehabilitation, surveillance, etc. The task can be defined as representation of actions as soon as they happen in a streaming video without access to video frames in the future. Most of the existing methods use predefined window sizes for video segments, which is a restrictive assumption on the dynamics. The proposed method employs a change detection algorithm to automatically segment action sequences, which form meaningful sub-actions and subsequently fit symbolic generative motion programs to the clipped segments. We determine the start time and end time of segments using change detection followed by a piece-wise linear fit algorithm on joint angle and bone length sequences. Domain-specific symbolic primitives are fit to pose keypoint trajectories of those extracted segments in order …",

        "Description": "Arterial stiffness, a proxy of vascular aging is an important marker of cardiovascular events and mortality, independent of traditional risk factors. The aortic or carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV) is the gold standard for determining arterial stiffness. Measuring arterial stiffness can help identify people who are at risk early on. State-of-the-art devices, majorly employing applanation tonometry at the carotid site, demand extensive skill, are costly, and are not intended for out-of-clinic use. However, a device that is suitable for homecare and primary health settings would facilitate primordial care. To address this gap, we have developed a novel easy-to-use, fully automated, and affordable photoplethysmography-based device for measuring cf-PWV. An in-vivo study on 25 subjects was conducted to investigate the device's usability by comparing self and expert-performed measurements, and by quantifying the user …",

Modelling approaches to flow rate waveforms offers a methodological and instrumentational advantage. However, current techniques are limited to the aortic site. For non-aortic sites such as carotid artery, modelling methods that were developed for aortic sites are not likely to capture the intrinsic differences in the carotid flow rate. In this work, a double-Rayleigh flow rate model for the carotid artery is developed to separate the forward and backward pressure waves using WSA (DRMWSA). The model parameters are optimally found based on characteristic features - obtained from the pressure waveform. The DRMWSA was validated using a database of 4374 virtual (healthy) subjects, and its performance was compared with actual flow rate based WSA (REFWSA) at the …",

        "Description": "Endothelial reactivity (ER) is widely measured using flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of brachial artery. Conventional measurement of FMD is influenced by factors such as input shear stress, arterial transmural pressure, diameter and thereby arterial material properties (ε). Thus, for a reliable interpretation of FMD, it has to be normalized with respect to the above confounding factors. Normalization of FMD with shear stress at the time of measurement has been reported to reduce measurement variability. However, its widespread usage among the research community is limited. In this work, we examine the feasibility of normalizing the brachial FMD index (FMD%) to ε : extrema (εp), baseline (εb) and extrema change (∆ε) post-ischemia using its inter-day variability against FMD.

In this work, we examine the material response (MR) of the artery during reactive hyperemia using clinically relevant stiffness markers for the assessment of endothelial reactivity (ER).

        "Description": "Local pulse wave velocity (PWV) has gained much attention in the last decade due to its ability to provide localized stiffness information from a target vessel and cater to several applications beyond regional PWV. Transit time-based methods are the most straightforward, but their reliability is highly dependent on the blood pulse sensing modality. Conventional ultrasound systems directly measure the blood pulse (as diameter or flow velocity); however, they offer limited frame rates resulting in poor resolution signals. Advanced systems supporting high frame rates are expensive, complex, and not amenable to field and resource-constraint settings. We have developed a high frame image-free ultrasound system to address this gap for automated and online measurement of local PWV. In an earlier in-vitro study, we have demonstrated its accuracy. In this work, we aim to investigate its in-vivo reliability. A study on 15 …",

Previous studies have reported age-related associations (both structural and functional) with PCA markers and stiffness. However, changes in functional stiffness under a drug produced due to the interplay of blood pressure and heart rate were not explored. In this work, we investigate the variation of PCA markers derived from the second derivative of invasive pressure waveform recorded from the carotid artery of an anaesthetized porcine model under drug intervention. The variations in PCA markers are compared with the functional stiffness surrogates (pulse wave velocity (PWV) _ regional and local), which are clinically relevant markers that vary with blood pressure and heart rate.

Measurements in sitting posture make stiffness assessment potentially more rapid and feasible for large-scale population-level field screening. However, the blood pressure (BP) required for stiffness evaluation must be compensated for any hydrostatic pressure offset while performing measurements in a sitting posture. In this work, we developed and validated a hydrostatic pressure compensation unit integrated with our A-mode ultrasound device for carotid artery stiffness. The system was characterized, and its design parameters were carefully considered for concurrence with a physiologically interesting range. The smallest change it could reliably measure was 2 mm, which corresponded to 0.3 mmHg of blood pressure. The device was validated on 20 human subjects (11 males and 9 females). The …",

        "Description": "Central Arteries' elastic nature plays a fundamental role in maintaining cardiovascular health. Timely assessment of arterial stiffness helps in cardiovascular risk stratification. Various technological and methodological approaches exist to estimate arterial stiffness, through direct measurement of stiffness markers or surrogates. This work highlights a potential surrogate for arterial stiffness, based on the early onset of reflection waves. The significance comes with using low frame rate A-mode ultrasound scans for processing arterial diameter, modelled as a sum of three Gaussians. The novelty lies in the Gaussian modelled reflection onset time ( τRGM ), derived using the model parameters, a potential surrogate for early reflections and arterial stiffness. An observational cross-sectional study group of 34 subjects were recruited to validate this hypothesis. A statistically significant (p 0.85 was obtained against Elastic …",

        "Description": "Existing ultrasound systems for the measurement of arterial wall dynamics make use of techniques such as doppler processing, phase locking, threshold detection, or cross-correlation based echo tracking. Applications that require only the maximum distension measure may not impose stringent demand on accuracy. However, the wall-tracking accuracy is a primary methodological consideration for the applications that depend on the true morphology of the entire distension waveform. In this work, we propose a novel image-free ultrasound approach to auto-track the arterial walls in a reliable manner, even in the presence of other dynamic echoes very adjacent to the wall echoes. The method uses the concept of dynamic time warping for estimating the varying shifts across various echoes in the scanned A-mode frames. We have demonstrated the method’s functionality in this article via. systematic simulation …",

Current clinical identification of sepsis includes culture-based methods that have a long turnaround time or monitoring of patient response that adds delay to therapy. There is currently no point-of-care care (PoC) device that allows both rapid and early sepsis diagnosis by the bedside. We have developed a portable colorimetric kit called Septiflo that gives concentration-dependent qualitative estimate of the sepsis-associated bacterial infection load in blood under 10 min. However, the results of this naked eye assessment remain somewhat subjective. In this paper, we present a handheld optical reader that can quantify the signal output of the Septiflo device making it a substantially more robust and accurate way to diagnose sepsis. The repeatability coefficient of variation (CoV) of this device when tested on five reference cartridges was found to …",

This is typically done using image based systems.ARTSENS1 is a portable, image free, ultrasound device for evaluating the stiffness of the CCA. ARTSENS emits a sequence of ultrasound pulses and records the reflected echoes. These echoes are then used to identify the CCA and estimate its diameter, and thereby evaluate the arterial stiffness.

Plaque depositions along the inner wall makes the arteries rigid and obstructs the flow of blood. This increases the risk of a heart attack. The dynamics of the inner-diameter of the CA is a good indicator of this risk. An ultrasound transducer is placed on the neck of a subject and a sequence of ultrasound pulses are sent. The echoes due to the CA and other anatomical structures in the vicinity are recorded. Considering each ultrasound pulse as an input and its corresponding echo (reflections from the CA and other structures) as the output, the propagation path is modeled as a FIR filter with a sparse impulse response. Reconstruction of the echo signal, for each pulse, from the estimated impulse response significantly reduces the measurement noise. This enables the …",

        "Description": "Adult Onset Still’s disease is an inflammatory disorder characterized by quotidian (daily) fevers, arthritis, and an evanescent rash. Neurological manifestations in a patient with Still’s Disease are very rare and usually occurs during the late stage of the disease. Only a few reports are available in literature. Neurological impairment in AOSD may lead to life-threatening complications, ie, brain stem hemorrhage, fatal seizures, hemiplegia, meningo-encephalitis, cranial nerve palsy, or sensorineural hearing loss. Here we report a patient with AOSD and right facial nerve palsy.",

        "Description": "A method to estimate the risk of heart disease in a person, based on diagnostic ultrasound is proposed here. The” vascular age” obtained from carotid ultrasound is very commonly used as a measure of cardiac health. Existing methods of vascular age estimation make use of the Carotid Intima Media Thickness (CIMT) measurements to arrive at an estimate of the vascular age. Recent work has demonstrated that the carotid inter adventitial distance (CAD) has a direct relation with the risk of coronary heart disease in persons. It has also been demonstrated that CAD correlates better to a number of risk factors accounting for heart disease than the CIMT. Hence, we propose a method to estimate vascular age based on CAD. B mode images of the carotid artery are analyzed to find out the carotid inter adventitial distance. The vascular age is estimated from carotid diameter using a statistical model developed based on …",
